# Hi, I'm Rohit 👋

I build **real-world software systems** focused on performance, reliability, and thoughtful design.

### What I work on
- ⚡ Peer-to-peer systems (WebRTC, resumable transfers)
- 🧠 AI & ML projects (image, emotion, generative models)
- 🌐 Full-stack apps (FastAPI backends with React & JavaScript frontends)
- 🚀 Developer tooling (Python CLIs, automation)

### Tech I use
Python · JavaScript · React · FastAPI · WebRTC · AsyncIO · Git · Linux

---
I enjoy building things that **actually solve problems**, not just demos.  
Currently polishing **Peerbeam** into a production-ready open-source tool.
